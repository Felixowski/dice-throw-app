# dice-throw-app
My first program 

Hi everyone!!
I'm starting lerning Java. I finished my first course on Udemy side and this is my first working app.
I know it isn't advanced but i just starded coding. Half of program have polish comment becous i'm from poland and not best in english.

This app is realy simple. Just throw a random number form 1 to 6 like regular dice and print resoult on consol.
I create grahic representation for every dice side in char arrays and use Switch to print resoult.
